Use **GitHub Releases** for the EXE. Release assets can be up to **2 GB per file** and don’t live in the repo, so they don’t bloat git.

### 1. Create a release and upload the EXE

1. Open your repo: **https://github.com/skeletor601/BL4-SaveEditor**
2. Click **Releases** (right side).
3. Click **“Create a new release”**.
4. **Choose a tag:** e.g. `v1.0` or `v3.4.5` (create the tag when prompted).
5. **Release title:** e.g. `BL4 AIO v3.4.5` or `Windows build 3.4.5`.
6. Add notes (what’s in this build, how to run it).
7. **Attach the EXE:** drag `dist/BL4_AIO.exe` into the “Attach binaries” area (or use the file picker).
8. Click **“Publish release”**.

The EXE will be at something like:  
`https://github.com/skeletor601/BL4-SaveEditor/releases/download/v1.0/BL4_AIO.exe`

You can share that link; people download the file, not from the repo itself.

### 2. Optional: automate with a script

You can add a small script that builds the EXE and then uses the GitHub CLI to create a release and upload the file (e.g. `gh release create`). If you want that, say your OS (Windows/Linux/mac) and we can sketch the commands.

### 3. Other options

- **itch.io** – Good for tools/games; simple upload, optional pay‑what‑you‑want.
- **Google Drive / OneDrive / Dropbox** – Easy, but link can change and looks less “official” than GitHub Releases.

For an open‑source project, **GitHub Releases** is usually the best place to host the EXE.
