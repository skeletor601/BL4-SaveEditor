,✨ Ultimate Item Parts List ✨,,,,,,,,,❤️ Special Thanks ❤️
,"This spreasheet is a compilation of work from many different individuals. It took many weeks to compile all of this data and we're still not finished! That said, it's about 95% COMPLETE and covers EVERY item in the game. 

I have spent the past few days compiling all of this data and putting it into a standardized format complete with in-game string names, stats and side effects. I’ve done my best to verify every single part, but I’m only human. If you notice any mistakes or inconsistencies, please let me know.

I would like to give a special thank you to everyone in the Borderlands Modding Discord for their hard work in assisting in the collection and compilation of this data.

,Mattmab,,CraZy Marty,,THATDONFC,,Geber,,,"1. What are item serials?
The game stores its weapons and items inside ""serials"" that looks like this:
      @Ugy3L+2}TYg%$yC%i7M2gZldO)@}cgb!l34$a-qf{00

These serials contains core informations about the item (ex: manufacturer, type, level, and its ""parts"").
However, as you can see... those informations are scrambled, and not easily readable nor modifiable."

,⚖️ Rules and boundaries regarding 2K and Gearbox:,,,,,,,,,
,"During the BL3 modding era, some people received a cease and desist letter from 2K.
This happened notably when people touched at paid or unreleased content.
In this mindset, we want to play fair and square.
=> We do not interfere with their revenue stream from paid content.

1. We don't touch paid DLC stuff.
If during research you stumble on stuff related to paid DLC items:
  => Stop and discard everything. Don't write anything in this spreadsheet.

2. We don't touch unreleased stuff.
If during research you stumble on stuff that is not released in the game:
  => Stop and discard everything. Don't write anything in this spreadsheet.

3. We don't accept donations.
This project is here to help build fun items, or adjust their weapons to their liking.
It is a community initiative that is completely free and accessible to all.
Important: were you asked to pay to access this document? If yes, this was a scam.
Please report as soon as possible to the discord server's moderators.

4. We don't touch game files.
We are not reading or modifying stuff from the game files.
 => We generate serials, put it inside our OWN save games, and write down the results.

Those rules may be frustrating, but they are important for protecting this research project.

The deserialization tool is available here:  https://borderlands4-deserializer.nicnl.com
Basically, it decodes the ""scrambled"" serials into their core values, making them easy to read.
But most importantly, the deserializer works both ways: you can modify the values and reserialize your item.
This allows you to adjust your trusty Daedalus Darkbeast by putting the glass scope you like best."

,,,,,,,,,,"3. Help, I don't understand the output of the deserializer!
Don't worry, it's not very complicated. Here are the basics.

We'll start with this serial, a ""Ricocheting GCX"":
  @UgwSAs2}TYg%+Cc1jp~P5)T82}IyDEC3v~`v4>e=}

Putting it in the deserializer gives the following result:
  20, 0, 1, 50| 2, 1439|| {96} {62} {5} {7} {88} {14} {25} {44} {51} {58} {1:12}|

Here is what those number means."

,,,,,,,,,,^^
,,,,,,,,,,"This is the manufacturer index : ""20"" means ""daedalus:smg"".
(See the ""Item Types & Manufacturers"" tab at the bottom.)
Usually you don't want to touch this number because it'll break the parts that comes afterwards."

,,,,,,,,,,          ^^
,,,,,,,,,,"This is the level => this weapon is level ""50"".
Do you want to bump the level of your item? Simply change this number, and you're good to go!
Note: currently, the game refuse item level higher than 50. If you set level 51 or higher, it won't spawn."

,,,,,,,,,,"The other parts following the first are the actual parts and effect of your weapon.
Problem, they can be anything: magazine, scope, barrel, underbarrel, grip, elemental effect...
Additionally, their meaning depends on the manufacturer index seen before :
    Example: ""{47}"" on a daedalus smg means something different on a jakobs sniper.
This is why this spreadsheet exists: we discover (by trial and error) what those parts are and write it down."

,,,,,,,,,,"In our example, the part {1:12} means it has fire elemental damage.
You can swap it to elemental shock damage by putting {1:14} instead.
(See ""Elemental effects"" tab at the bottom.)

Please keep in mind that we haven't figured out all the parts yet.
So... just explore this spreadsheet, and try to find the informations you want.
If you don't find what you need, it simply hasn't been discovered yet."
